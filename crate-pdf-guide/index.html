<h1 id="grim-dawn-pdf-guide">Grim Dawn PDF Guide</h1>
<p>Version 1.2 ©2016 Crate Entertainment, LLC.</p>
<p>Grim Dawn features a powerful set of modding tools, available for free to all owners of the game.
Because these are the same tools we used to create the game itself, they offer an exceptional degree of
freedom for you to edit and create your very own content.</p>
<p>Modding can be a challenging, but rewarding endeavor. The freedom provided by our tools does mean
that there is a steeper learning curve if you wish to tackle some of its more powerful functions. Not all
tasks are created equal. For example, editing an item’s stats is considerably easier than scripting an
event where monsters attack a village.</p>
<p>To aid you in the creation of your first mod, we have created these tutorials, which go over the basics of
using Grim Dawn’s modding tools and get you started on your way to creating your own content!</p>
<p>Note that these tutorials are not fully comprehensive. They do not touch upon the finest nuances that
may require an expert user and will not teach you how to make game assets such as models, animations
and special effects.</p>
<p>We here at Crate Entertainment are excited to see everything that our players will come up with.
Welcome to the Grim Dawn modding tools!</p>
<h2 id="tutorial-list">Tutorial List:</h2>
<p>Tutorial 01 - Asset Manager, how to create new mods and manage mod assets
Tutorial 02 - World Editor, the basic functions for building and editing environments
Tutorial 03 - Quests, the creation of quests (main story and side content)
Tutorial 04 - Conversations, the creation of NPC dialogue (which can grant quests)
Tutorial 05 - Monsters, the creation of basic enemies and boss monsters
Tutorial 06 - Equipment, the creation of basic loot and loot tables
Tutorial 07 - Scripting, an advanced tutorial on Lua scripting in Grim Dawn</p>
<h2 id="moddingtutorial-reference-mod">ModdingTutorial Reference Mod</h2>
<p>Your installation of Grim Dawn comes with a pre-made test mod called ModdingTutorial. This mod
serves as a frame of reference for a variety of features and gameplay elements, such as questing, Lua
scripting and monsters. All of the source files for this mod are included, so you can make changes and
see how they impact the mod.</p>
<p>To check out the tutorial mod, simply extract ModdingTutorial.zip (located in the game installation
folder) into the “/mods” directory. Note that if you change the Working directory (see Asset Manager
tutorial), the location you need to place the source files will be different.</p>
<h2 id="tutorial-01-asset-manager">Tutorial 01: Asset Manager</h2>
<p>This tutorial covers the Asset Manager and creating a new mod. Before you can work on a mod, you will
need to launch the Asset Manager to perform First-Time Setup. You will also want to Extract Core Game
Files so that you can access the game’s default templates (for the creation of new files) and database
(for referencing existing game files).</p>
<h2 id="first-time-setup">First-Time Setup</h2>
<p>When you start up the Asset Manager for the first time, you will be asked to create a Working and Build
directory. These are set to the game’s installation directory by default so that the World Editor and
other mod tools can load the default game assets. If you choose to change the Build directory, note that
your tools will not load the game’s assets and will instead load only assets you create in your mod.</p>
<h2 id="extracting-core-game-files">Extracting Core Game Files</h2>
<p>Chances are that you may want to make a mod that alters existing game data rather than creating
something entirely new. Or perhaps you just want to take a peek under the hood and see how certain
things in Grim Dawn were made. To facilitate this process, the Asset Manager is capable of extracting all
of the game’s database, template and asset files for reference purposes. Template files will be critical to
creating new game records, such as items, monsters and skills. Database records and templates are
extracted to /database while assets are extracted to /resources.</p>
<p>To extract game files, go to Tools -&gt; Extract Game Files and select the Grim Dawn installation directory
(default: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Grim Dawn). This will overwrite any
existing files in the /database and /resources folders, so do not run this process if you have files in there
you are working on. This will rip all of the records, assets and template files from the core game
archives.</p>
<p>Note: this requires at least 5gb of additional storage space on your hard drive as you are extracting
compressed game files. This process may take several minutes during which the Asset Manager may
become non-responsive.</p>
<p>If these files are placed within your mod following the same folder structure as the base game (ex.
database/records/items/gearhead/a01_head001.dbr), then any changes you make will overwrite the
original file while you are running your mod.</p>
<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<p>The Asset Manager is where all your mod files will be stored and organized. They are organized under 3
Tabs: Sources, Assets and Database.</p>
<p>Sources is where core game files are stored. These are anything from art assets (models, animations,
textures) to sounds to quests and NPC conversations.</p>
<p>Assets is where various source files are referenced in a format recognized by the game so that they can
be assigned to Database files (ex. a model may have a .msh asset which a decoration uses).</p>
<p>Database is where files that define gameplay elements are stored. These are things such as monsters,
NPCs, level art, equipment and skills.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-new-mod">Creating a New Mod</h2>
<p>Once you are comfortable enough with the tutorial mod, you will likely want to create your own. To do
this, you must first create a new Mod in the Asset Manager.</p>
<p>Go to Mod -&gt; New</p>
<p>Enter a name for your Mod and press OK.</p>
<p>The mod will be created with several important directories already added for you. These directories
should not be deleted/renamed if you like your mod working. The folder names are pretty self-
explanatory.</p>
<p>Sources/Maps: this directory is where all the world map data should be saved. You can create sub-
directories here for organization purposes.</p>
<p>Sources/Quests: this directory is where all quest files should be saved. You can create sub-directories
here for organization purposes.</p>
<p>Sources/Scripts: this directory is where main.lua needs to be placed as an entry point. All other script files
can go wherever you wish.</p>
<p>Sources/Text_EN: this directory is where all string files (.txt) should be saved. This is how you define the
names of objects in the game world (ex. tag_Sword01=Sharpened Sword)</p>
<p>How you organize other types of files is up to you.</p>
<h2 id="adding-new-files-and-folders">Adding New Files and Folders</h2>
<p>To create a new folder, or sub-folder, right-click in the folder list and select Create Directory. Name your
folder as desired.</p>
<p>When in the Database tab, you can also create new Database Records (.dbr). These records come
without a template, which must be assigned in order to edit it further.</p>
<h2 id="adding-external-files-to-the-mod">Adding External Files to the Mod</h2>
<p>Now that you have a brand new mod, you probably want to put something in it (a reasonable request).
Since your mod starts out empty, you will begin by creating files outside of the Asset Manager that then
need to be added to your mod. Once you’ve established a file base, you can copy-paste files within the
Asset Manager if you want to create variants of things you’ve created before.</p>
<p>Source and Database Files
If you created Source or Database Files outside of the Asset Manager (ex. quest, conversation, art files,
monster database record (.dbr)), if you place them inside of a directory contained within your mod,
simply selecting another folder inside of the Asset Manager and then return to the original directory to
refresh it. Note that you will need to restart the Asset Manager if you add a new folder outside of it.</p>
<p>Asset Files
Asset files are created by right-clicking Source files in the Asset Manager and selecting Auto-Create
Asset. Depending on the file type, you may have to select a type of Asset to create.</p>
<p>Source files that require an Asset:</p>
<p> Conversations
 Quests
 Art files such as textures, models and animations
 Special Effects
 Sounds
 Lua scripts
 The World (.wrl)</p>
<h2 id="3ds-max-exporter">3ds Max Exporter</h2>
<p>Grim Dawn comes with .dlo and .dll files for the following 32-bit versions of 3ds Max: 2009, 2011 and
2012, allowing you to create and import your own meshes and animations into the game. The files are
available in the installation directory for the game.</p>
<h2 id="compiling-a-mod">Compiling a Mod</h2>
<p>Once you’ve made all the desired changes and additions to your mod, it is time to test it!</p>
<p>Simply go to Build -&gt; Build in the Asset Manager to compile your changes. Make sure you do not have
any editing tools open, such as the World Editor. Once the Asset Manager is finished, you can launch the
game and try out your mod.</p>
<p>Enjoy your hard work!</p>
<p>Packaging a Mod for Sharing with the World
Sooner or later, a time may come when you want to share your hard work with the rest of the world. In
order to do this, you will need to package up your mod build files. The files other players need to play
your mod are:</p>
<p> /steamapps/common/Grim Dawn/mods/ModName/database.arz
 /steamapps/common/Grim Dawn/mods/ModName/resources/*.arc</p>
<p>Preserve the file structure in a .zip (or other compressed format). Other players must then extract your
files in /steamapps/common/Grim Dawn/mods/. Remember to include all of the .arc files.</p>
<p>All the other files are source files for your mod and are only required to actually work on the mod and its
contents. They do not need to be shared unless you want to share your work with a team of modders or
simply wish for your work to be open to editing by the public.</p>
<h2 id="tutorial-02-world-editor">Tutorial 02: World Editor</h2>
<p>This tutorial covers the World Editor and its many functions which you will need to learn in order to
create your own levels, fill them with content and bring your ideas to life.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-new-world">Creating a New World</h2>
<p>Before you can create levels, you must have a world to put them in. When you first launch the editor,
you will have the option to do so. We recommend saving it in Sources/Levels/</p>
<p>Once you name your world, you will be presented with the infinite blackness of the world editor,
because there are no regions in it yet! To add a region, go to Region -&gt; Add New Terrain</p>
<p>You will see a similar window to creating your World (again, we recommend placing the levels in
Sources/Levels/), but here you can also set the size of the region.</p>
<p>For optimal performance, we recommend an off-set grid system of 128x128 regions, which looks like
this once you’ve added a few:</p>
<p>When you’re finished building up the basis of your world, select one of the regions and click the Go-To
button at the top.</p>
<h2 id="object-tools">Object Tools</h2>
<p>Placement Tool
This tool allows you to search through the database to place objects within the world such as
decorations, spawners, scripted entities and dungeon entrances. You can search this list as well as add
objects to your palette for easier retrieval later.</p>
<p>Group Link Tool
This tool is used to link objects together, which is important for randomizing spawns, barriers and
connecting Dungeon Entrances.</p>
<p>First you must create a group and name it, then select the type of group it is:</p>
<p> Respawns, all spawn points in the world must be connected so that only one is active at any
given time.
 Unified Entities, used to spawn the same object from a group of SetPiece objects.
 Proxy Patrollers, used to connect a Proxy with a set of patrol points. A proxy is grouped this way,
then Linked to a group of Patrol Points.
 Unique Entities, used to randomly create only one entity out of a group. This is useful for
randomizing where a Proxy or SetPiece Spawns
 Inverse Unique Entities, used to randomly create all but one of the entities in a group. This is
useful for randomizing barriers such that only one way through is open.
 Any Entity, used to group together randomized Rifts. Only one will appear in the world.
 Decorations, used to group Decorations together. This is seldom used with the SetPiece system,
which uses Unique Entities.
 Patrol Points, used to group Patrol Points for a Proxy to follow.
 Monsters and Weapons, this is an old setting and is no longer used with Proxies and SetPieces.
 Patrollers, used similarly to Proxy Patrollers but for individual entities such as guards.
 Wander Points, used to group Wander Points for NPCs to follow. As we keep NPCs static, this is
unused.
 NPC wanderers, used similarly to Proxy Patrollers but for individual NPCs.
 Riftgates, used to link all of the Riftgates in the world so they become a network for fast travel. If
a riftgate is not in this group, it will not be remembered by the player’s character.
 Dungeon Entrances, used to link transition doors together. This is important for Dungeon
Entrances and transitions between dungeon floors.
 Devotion Shrines, used to link all Devotion Shrines in the world so they become a network. If a
shrine is not in this group, it will not be properly stored by the player’s character.</p>
<p>Link Mode is used to connect dungeon entrances when one or both sides are randomized (ex.
Randomized Rift entrance). It is important that the link is made in both directions or the entrance will
not work. To link two groups together, you toggle Link Mode and click on the black Dot that indicates
the center point of the group you are linking to.</p>
<h2 id="terrain-tools">Terrain Tools</h2>
<p>The following tools all can be modified by holding Shift or Alt. Generally, holding Shift will alternate its
functionality whereas Alt will prevent the terrain tool from displacing already placed assets.</p>
<p>Raise/Lower Tool
Use this tool to raise or lower the terrain.</p>
<p>Noise Tool
Use this tool to create randomized bumps in the terrain.</p>
<p>Smooth Tool
Use this tool to even out the variation between terrain of differing heights.</p>
<p>Plateau Tool
Use this tool to set a section of terrain to a fixed height.</p>
<p>Raise Plateau Tool
Use this tool to raise the terrain by a fixed amount. The relative difference between terrain remains the
same.</p>
<p>Copy Terrain Tool
This tool functions similarly to copying and pasting in a text document. CTRL+C copies an area, CTRL+V
pastes it. Left-clicking also pastes your last selection.</p>
<p>Ramp Tool
Use this tool to create ramps from the starting point to the end point you click and hold to.</p>
<p>Brush Tool
Use this tool to apply terrain textures. You can also set it to apply onto paintable decorations, such as
slabs of stone or bridges.</p>
<p>No Pathing Tool
Use this tool to paint over areas you do not want players or monsters to go. Areas painted this way will
be omitted when you generate pathing for your level. This only functions on terrain. Objects that
generate a path mesh will override this if they are over the painted area.</p>
<p>Sector Paint Tool
Use this tool to apply various environmental settings, such as Lighting and Level Limits.</p>
<p>Fog/Lighting Layer
The Fog/Lighting Layer is used to control the ambience of the region. For Fog, you can set the visible
distance, density, height and color. For Lighting, you can set the Light Color, the Ambient color for the
sky and the Ambient color for the ground. Example, the atmosphere turns to an Aether green when
entering Aetherfire. That visual is set in this layer.</p>
<p>Name Layer
The Name Layer determines what name appears whenever the player enters the area (ex. Devil’s
Crossing appears on screen when enering Devil’s Crossing).</p>
<p> Localization Tag – the tag reference to what players see.
 Cinematic Display – checked so the name appears in the center of the screen when first entering
the area.
 Display Once – unchecked, otherwise the name only appears the first time.</p>
<p>Sound Layer
The Sound Layer is used to set the music and ambient sounds for an area. The sound layer references
DBRs.</p>
<p> Ambient Music – what music is played in this area.
 Ambient Sound – what ambient sounds randomly play in this area.
 Event Music – music triggered by a special event.</p>
<p>Boss Layer
The Boss Layer is used to control where special Boss Music plays. It has no settings of its own and must
be associated with a Boss Monster that has custom Music assigned to it.</p>
<p>Day/Night Cycle Layer
The Day/Night Cycle Layer controls the atmospheric effects simulating sunrise/sundown.</p>
<p>Bloom Layer
The Bloom Layer is an atmospherics layer used to adjust the Brightness, Contrast and Saturation for the
bright areas in a scene. It works similarly to HDR.</p>
<p>Climate Layer
The Climate Layer is used to control weather effects such as dense fog, rain, wind, etc. The Climate layer
references a Climate DBR, which is where all of the settings are stored.</p>
<p>Damage Layer
The Damage Layer is used to deal damage to the player when they enter an environmental hazard. You
set the type of damage, the visual effect (generally should be the one associated with the damage type)
and the % health that is lost per second of standing within the hazard.</p>
<p>Adjustment Layer
The Adjustment Layer is another atmospheric layer which controls the Brightness, Contrast, Saturation
and Hue of the entire scene. Unlike the Bloom Layer, it also impacts dark areas.</p>
<p>Level Limit Layer
The Level Limit Layer controls what level monsters can spawn in the area. The Minimum level and
Maximum level are used whenever the player’s level falls outside of that range, otherwise the player’s
level is used. The Offset is added to the player’s level so that monsters always end up a few levels above
the player (unless the player’s level is above Maximum level). The Offset is only used in challenge areas.</p>
<p>Riftgate Disable Layer
The Riftgate Disable Layer is used to prevent players from being able to open a Personal Riftgate while
within the area. It is used exclusive for very challenging areas or for Faction-Only hideouts.</p>
<p>View Distance Layer
This layer is used to control how far away objects are loaded, to improve performance in areas where
you do not necessarily see more than a few dozen meters out. A really flat area could be set to 80m,
while a really tall mountain may need 300.</p>
<p>PVP Layer:
The area painted over with this layer disables Player versus Player hostility. Used to create safe zones.</p>
<h2 id="other-tools">Other Tools</h2>
<p>The following tools do not interact with the terrain or server special functions.</p>
<p>Water Tool
Use this tool to create bodies of water.</p>
<p>River Tool
Use this tool to place river points, which generate a flowing river. Hold Shift to place a point. Press
Backspace to delete the last placed point.</p>
<p>Wave Tool
Use this tool to place wave points, which generate waves between them. Hold Shift to place a point.
Press Backspace to delete the last placed point.</p>
<p>Zoom Tool
Use this tool to click and drag over an area and zoom in on it.</p>
<p>Undo/Redo
Use this tool to undo/redo the last Terrain or Asset action you performed. Does not interact with the
Water/River/Wave tools.</p>
<p>Default Zoom
Click this button to reset the camera zoom to the default distance for players. Useful for seeing what the
player would see without adjusting their zoom. One to two clicks out will generally show you what a
player playing at 1920x1080 will see.</p>
<p>Default Camera Angle
Click this button to reset the camera angle to the default for players. Useful for seeing what the player
would see without rotating the camera.</p>
<h2 id="updating-pathing-and-the-map">Updating Pathing and the Map</h2>
<p>Once you’ve finished building up your level, you will need to generate pathing and a map. To do, return
to Layout Mode then select all of your regions that you wish to update. Under the Build menu, select
Rebuild Selected Pathing. Next, return to the Build menu and select Rebuild Selected Map.</p>
<p>To see if your path mesh is good and does not create any weird dead spots or tight passages, you can
return to Editor Mode. Under the View menu, select Path Mesh preview.</p>
<h2 id="placing-the-spawn-and-respawn-points">Placing the Spawn and Respawn Points</h2>
<p>A player will not be able to spawn in your level unless you place a spawn point. You should only have
one spawn point in your level. This is where the player will begin their journey in your world.</p>
<p>You can also place Respawn Points, which is where the player will return if their character dies. If you
use multiple Respawn Points, such as for multiple safe zones the player can reach, they will need to be
grouped using the Group Link tool.</p>
<p>To place these points, use the Placement Tool. The Default Spawn and Respawn points are in Records -&gt;
Controllers -&gt; Player</p>
<h2 id="finishing-up">Finishing Up</h2>
<p>When you are finished with your world, Save and Close the editor. Return to the Asset Manager and
Build your changes.</p>
<p>Enjoy your level!</p>
<h2 id="tutorial-03-quest-editor">Tutorial 03: Quest Editor</h2>
<p>The Grim Dawn quest tool was built to be flexible, allowing for branching resolutions and script-
triggered completion. This flexibility does mean that special attention must be paid to the
implementation in order to avoid errors and potential exploits, especially when scripting is involved.</p>
<p>Care also has to be taken to ensure that any given quest choice or incompletion of the quest does not
create future dependencies or conflicts. This becomes all the more important for Multiplayer as you
have to assume players can be everywhere at once.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-new-quest">Creating a New Quest</h2>
<p>When you create a new quest within the Quest Editor, the first quest task is automatically created for
you, but all of the important fields are left blank.</p>
<p>Quest Log Sub-section Name
All quests with the same text entered here will be sorted under the same sub-list in the Quest Log.</p>
<p>Quest Name
If you right-click this line, you can copy the Quest ID. This is important for scripting, so copy it for later
reference with a “0x” added to the front (example quest ID: 6E48AA00, to use this for a script it has to
be 0x6E48AA00).</p>
<p>Note that if you copy an existing quest, its Quest ID will also be the same, which will create issues. All
quest IDs must be unique. To generate a new Quest ID, go to Quest -&gt; Regenerate Quest ID.</p>
<p>Task Name
This is for internal reference only and does not appear in-game, but it is helpful to label this in a way you
will recognize (ex. Kill Reanimator or Return to Bourbon) as you will see it again when connecting Quest
Tasks or Conversations. If you right-click this line, you can copy the Task ID. This is important for
scripting, so copy it for later reference with a “0x” added to the front (example task ID: 6483C880, to use
this for a script it has to be 0x6483C880)</p>
<p>Task Description
The quest description players see in the quest log. This description is not cumulative, so when a new
Task begins within a quest, it overwrites the description in the quest log.</p>
<p>OnAccept
The actions that are triggered when this Task begins. These can be restricted to only trigger based on
given conditions.</p>
<p>Objectives
The objectives that must be completed for this Task. Each objective has a display text and a condition
that must be met. These conditions can also trigger actions.</p>
<p>OnComplete
The actions that are triggered when this Task is marked as complete, which will occur automatically
when all objectives are completed or via a call from a Script/Dialogue. This is where quest rewards go for
the final task.</p>
<h2 id="quest-conditions-and-actions-for-mods">Quest Conditions and Actions for Mods</h2>
<p>By default, the Quest Editor only detects quest lists and Lua scripts from within the base game. In order
to assign quests and functions from mods into conditions/actions, you must change the instance of the
Quest Editor to the respective mod. To do so, select the mod you wish to work with from the drop-down
on the top-right of the editor.</p>
<p>By default, this is set to Grim Dawn (the base game). The Quest Editor will remember what mod it was
last set to for ease of use.</p>
<h2 id="quests-tasks">Quests Tasks</h2>
<p>Quests are sorted into Tasks. Each Task is a collection of objectives, conditions, and actions. A quest can
contain multiple Tasks, but the player should never be on more than one Task within a quest at any
given time. You can think of Tasks as chapters within a short story.</p>
<p>You can add additional Tasks by double-clicking the Quest Name. Tasks can be chained together with a
series of “CompleteQuestTask” and “BeginQuestTask” actions, or via an NPC dialogue that performs
those same Actions.</p>
<h2 id="tokens">Tokens:</h2>
<p>Tokens are special text tags that are stored in the player’s save data. These tags can then be referenced
within quests, scripts and NPC dialogue. They are essentially true/false variables in that you test for
whether a player has a specific tag or not. They can be granted to a player via dialogue, quests, and
scripts. Items, monsters, and trigger volumes can bestow tokens by calling a script.</p>
<p>Example 1:
The player kills a quest monster. The monster grants a token confirming that the player has
killed it even though he was not on the quest. If the player acquires the quest in the future, he
can claim credit for the kill without having to hunt the monster down again.</p>
<p>Example 2:
The player finds a key. Upon picking it up, the key grants a token which grants access to a special
dungeon.</p>
<h2 id="completing-a-quest">Completing a Quest</h2>
<p>For the final task of a quest (this could be multiple tasks if there are choices involved), you will want to
do several things:</p>
<p> Run the CompleteQuest Action on the quest
 Remove or replace any Tokens the player no longer needs
 Give out rewards based on the game difficulty</p>
<h2 id="main-quest-versus-side-quest">Main Quest versus Side Quest</h2>
<p>If a quest is part of your Main Quest line, as opposed to a side quest, you can designate it as such by
right-clicking on the Quest Name field and checking “Main Quest”.</p>
<h2 id="repeatable-quest">Repeatable Quest</h2>
<p>If you wish for a quest to be repeatable by the player, you can mark it as Repeatable by right-clicking on
the Quest Name field and checking “Repeatable”. This will allow the player to accept the quest again
and again, even in the same game session.</p>
<h2 id="special-cases-for-multiplayer">Special Cases for Multiplayer</h2>
<p>When dealing with multiplayer, there are two more special tags you can apply which can help resolve
unusual circumstances creating by having more than one player in the game.</p>
<p>Don’t Propagate
If you have a task that you wish for each player to complete individually (ex. turning in a special item),
you can mark the task to not automatically propagate completion to all players that are also on the
same task. To do so, right-click the task and check Don’t Propagate.</p>
<p>Blocker Task
Normally, if a quest is already completed by the host, players who join can no longer complete that
quest in that game session. This is done to prevent conflicts in dialogue or the executing of scripts that
should not be run multiple times (or ones that already ran and create paradoxes in the joining player’s
story progression).</p>
<p>However, this automatic system does not apply for when the host and a joining player are on the same
quest, but the host is a task or more ahead. Sometimes this works out fine (ex. Requiring a player to Find
A Location can be automatically completed for all players present if the host already found this
location), but it can cause a problem if the host has just killed a boss that a joining player still needs. The
joining player would then have a quest they cannot complete in that session.</p>
<p>To prevent such scenarios, you can right-click on a task and check Blocker Task, so that a player joining
the game on the same quest as the host but after the quest target has been dealt with will have the
quest properly Blocked.</p>
<h2 id="quest-markers">Quest Markers</h2>
<p>To aid players in find quest targets, you can mark them. Whether you are marking a monster, item, or
dungeon entrance, you need to edit the DBR section called Quest Marker. There you can set the quest
file, the Task ID and the markerRange (distance at which it appears on the minimap).</p>
<p>You can also create an Area of Interest, which is a DBR entry that allows you to place an invisible dot in
the game world. These markers are also good for marking dungeon entrances on the local map. If a
marker is only for a quest, set questOnly to true.</p>
<h2 id="finishing-up_1">Finishing Up</h2>
<p>When you are finished with your quest, Save and Close the Quest Editor. Return to the Asset Manager to
create an asset for it, as quests require one before they can function in the game.</p>
<p>Before you can go off and send players on your quest though, you have to add the quest to your world
by using the World Editor. With your world loaded, go to the Quest Menu -&gt; Select Files. Add your new
quest to this list and save on exit.</p>
<h2 id="tutorial-04-conversation-editor">Tutorial 04: Conversation Editor</h2>
<p>The Grim Dawn conversation tool is versatile, capable of handling complex multi-ending NPC
conversations and executing scripts. Because of this there are some important considerations that must
be kept in mind when creating NPC conversation logic.</p>
<p>Because of the possibility of choice-and-consequence in Grim Dawn’s questing, only one player can talk
to an NPC at a time. However, as players in a multiplayer session can be in many places at once, care
must be taken when creating NPCs that impact each other’s dialogues.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-new-conversation">Creating a New Conversation</h2>
<p>When you create a new conversation within the Conversation Editor, the only field available will be the
Name field that is displayed in the NPC’s dialogue window. You should have this match the name of the
NPC that is talking.</p>
<p>At this point you need to add Speech Nodes, which in turn will have their own Player Dialogue Nodes
branching off. Using these you can create an intricate dialogue web with many resolutions and bits of
information. An NPC can have as many things to say as you desire.</p>
<p>For all of the types of dialogue nodes, you can execute both Conditions, which determine if the player
can see the speech or dialogue option, and Actions, which execute various quest and script events.</p>
<p>Speech Node
When you double-click the NPC Name field, a new Speech Node will be created. Speech Nodes are the
text that the NPC will display to the player.</p>
<p>Speech Nodes are processed from top to bottom. What this means is that if a Node at the top is valid, it
will be used even if another valid Node exists underneath it. This is important for managing quest logic
for multi-ending or multi-quest NPCs. Because of this, you need to carefully set Conditions for each
Speech Node.</p>
<p>Typically, the bottom-most Node has no condition and serves as a catch-all, or starting, Dialogue. This
dialogue can then lead to others, such as a quest offer or quest turn-in, which would have Conditions
the player has to meet (example Player Is on Quest Task A and Has Item).</p>
<p>Continue Node
A Continue Node is a player response that leads to another Speech Node. Use this when the player can
choose where a conversation goes next or to ask a question.</p>
<p>End Conversation Node
An End Conversation Node does exactly as it implies: it allows the player to end the conversation. It can
still execute Actions though, which is useful for turning in quests or making an NPC swap into a hostile
foe.</p>
<p>Accept/Decline Node
An Accept Node is a special type of End Conversation Node used when you want to use a Checkmark
and X choice for the player, such as when offering a quest. Generally, an Accept node will execute
Actions whereas a Decline node simply ends the conversation.</p>
<h2 id="conversation-conditions-and-actions-for-mods">Conversation Conditions and Actions for Mods</h2>
<p>By default, the Conversation Editor only detects quest lists and Lua scripts from within the base game. In
order to assign quests and functions from mods into conditions/actions, you must change the instance
of the Conversation Editor to the respective mod. To do so, select the mod you wish to work with from
the drop-down on the top-right of the editor.</p>
<p>By default, this is set to Grim Dawn (the base game). The Conversation Editor will remember what mod
it was last set to for ease of use.</p>
<h2 id="granting-a-quest-in-multiplayer">Granting a Quest in Multiplayer</h2>
<p>When a player accepts a quest via a Conversation, this does not automatically propagate to all players in
a session, as those players did not necessarily go through the same Conversation logic to reach the same
quest offer and may actually not be eligible.</p>
<p>To handle this, we execute a global quest offer via Lua Scripting. Lua Scripting for quests is covered in
Tutorial 07.</p>
<p>If you wish to make a gameplay scenario for Multiplayer, we highly recommend studying the Granting
Multiplayer Quests section of the Lua Scripting tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="linking-dialogues">Linking Dialogues</h2>
<p>When you have a dialogue that logically leads to another existing one, you can link the two dialogues
together without rewriting the same thing several times. To do so, simply Copy (CTRL+C) a dialogue
node (can be any type except End Conversation), then select the dialogue you want leading to this same
node and Paste as Link (CTRL+L). The dialogue you are linking has to logically connect, so you cannot
have a Speech Node connect to another Speech Node, but you can have a Speech Node linked to several
Continue Nodes.</p>
<h2 id="random-speech">Random Speech</h2>
<p>A random speech node is a collection of Speech Nodes that will randomly be selected. Use this to have
an NPC tell the player a random quip each time they are visited.</p>
<h2 id="assigning-voiceovers">Assigning Voiceovers</h2>
<p>If you decide to include your own voice-overs for NPCs, you will need to assign the recordings to each
Speech Node. To do so, right-click the desired Speech Node and select the appropriate .wav Asset from
the list.</p>
<h2 id="finishing-up_2">Finishing Up</h2>
<p>When you are finished with your conversation, Save and Close the Conversation Editor. Return to the
Asset Manager to create an asset for it, as conversations require one before they can function in the
game.</p>
<p>To assign a Conversation to an NPC, open its DBR and go to the Conversation section and assign the
appropriate Conversation Asset.</p>
<h2 id="tutorial-05-creating-a-monster">Tutorial 05: Creating a Monster</h2>
<p>Monsters are created and modified using Grim Dawn’s Database Record (DBR) Editor. There are many
parts that go into making a monster, which are broken down in this tutorial.</p>
<p>1) Dig up appropriate body parts
2) Combine them in Primordial broth
3) Stir
4) Stir some more
5) Name the monster
6) Run faster than the guy next to you</p>
<h2 id="monster-record">Monster Record</h2>
<p>The first step to creating a monster is to create its Database Record (DBR). The Monster Record
references other records and assets, such as sounds and animations. Generally it is better to take an
existing DBR and modify it as there are many data fields that must be entered which will not be covered
in this guide.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this tutorial, we will assume that you are not making new models, animations or
sound files but instead will be basing your monster on an existing archetype.</p>
<p>Monster Parameters</p>
<p>Monster Controller
The Monster Controller is a separate DBR that sets various parameters for the monster such as
when to flee, when to assist, vision range, hate generation (threat), and more. For the most
part, you will be using existing Controllers.</p>
<p>Monster Classification
The monster classification determines the color of the monster’s name in the Target Info section
of the HUD as well as the multipliers the monster uses to determine the quality of its loot.</p>
<p> Common: used for fodder monsters that pose minimal challenge individually
 Champion: used for mid-tier monsters that pose some challenge individually but throw
in additional mechanics in a group fight and should be prioritized.
 Hero: used for hero monsters with custom skill sets. They are marked by a hero star
above their head.
 Quest: used for boss and mini-boss monsters with custom skill sets.
 Boss: used for Nemesis bosses.</p>
<p>Per Party Member Drop Item Name/Chance
This parameter is used to set what item this monster drops per player in a multiplayer session.
You can also set a chance if you do not wish for it to drop 100% of the time. Useful for quest
drops and lore notes.</p>
<p>Drop Items
A true/false check for whether the monster can drop what it has equipped. Generally set to
False for summons and true for everything else.</p>
<p>Give XP
A true/false check for whether the monster grants XP when killed. Generally set to False for
summons and true for everything else.</p>
<p>Health Gain on Kill Percent/Difficulty
The % Health the monster regains if it kills a player. The Difficulty determines at what difficulty
this health regains activates (0 = Normal, 1 = Veteran, 2 = Elite, 3 = Ultimate). For all bosses, the
health regain starts on Veteran. Nemesis bosses regain health regardless of difficulty.</p>
<p>Character</p>
<p>Char Level
The Char Level is an equation for the monster’s level relative to the player’s. This is only used if
the monster is placed directly into the world and not spawned via Proxy. The Min/Max Level
parameters are caps on the formula. (example formula: charLevel*1+3)</p>
<p>Experience Points
Bonus experience for killing this monster, generally only set for heroes and above.</p>
<p>Character Gender Profile
The Gender Profile is used only for Human-based monsters as it determines the equipment
gender overrides (if set incorrectly you could end up with A female character using a male
torso).</p>
<p>Character Racial Profile
The Racial Profile is used to tag the monster with various Cairn races for the purposes of Bonus
Damage. A monster may have more than one profile at a time (Example: Human Cultists are
both Human and Bloodsworn). The default game races are as follows:</p>
<p> Race001 = Undead
 Race002 = Beastkin
 Race003 = Aetherial
 Race004 = Chthonic
 Race005 = Aether Corruption
 Race006 = Bloodsworn
 Race007 = Eldritch
 Race008 = Insectoid
 Race009 = Human
 Race010 = Construct
 Race011 = Riftspawn
 Race012 = Beast
 Race013 = Magical
 Race014 = Celestial
 Race015 = Arachnid</p>
<p>Default Equipment
The default equipment is used to give the monster items to visually change its appearance
without that equipment having a chance to drop. This is mostly relevant for Human-based
monsters that wear player equipment visually, but is also relevant for tribal monsters where the
champions might wear armor (that the player cannot wear) while the fodder monsters do not.</p>
<p>Weapon Scale
Weapon Scale is used to scale up the model size of any weapons the monster uses, useful for
large monsters that use player gear. When the weapons drop, they are reduced back down to
the original scale.</p>
<p>Number Attack/Defense Slots
Attack Slots are important for very large monsters so that pets and other entities can attack
them at the same time. The Default of 4 is sufficient in most cases, but a particularly large</p>
<p>monster may need more if it is difficult for entities to reach it from multiple sides (example: the
Loghorrean uses 26).</p>
<p>Start Visible
A true/false check whether the monster initially spawns visible. This is important for monsters
that are ambushing from above. These monsters must be set to appear visible in the spawn
animation or else they will be permanently invisible.</p>
<p>Distress Call
A true/false check on whether the monster calls for help. If set to true, the range determines
how far the distress call reaches, the group determines the group of monsters that is called (all
monsters with the same group set here and in the controller will respond), the call time is the
delay between additional distress calls and the max calls is the maximum number of times the
monster will call for help.</p>
<p>Invincible
If set to true, this monster cannot be killed. This is useful for environment traps.</p>
<p>Hidden From Combat
If set to true, the monster will not cause other non-player entities to attack it.</p>
<p>Causes Anger / Anger Multiplier
A true/false check on whether the monster generates threat with other non-player entities. The
multiplier can be used to reduce its threat generated without completely disabling it.</p>
<p>Upper/Lower Health Display Percentage
Used for bosses with multiple phases. This way you can keep one continuous health progress
bar across all phases. The Upper is the starting % of health and Lower is the ending % of Health
when the next phase would begin. (Example: Phase 1 would be 100 for Upper and 50 for Lower
and Phase 2 would be 50 for Upper and 0 for Lower in a two phase encounter).</p>
<p>Hit Threshold
The % of health the monster must lose in one hit before it is staggered by the blow. Bosses
generally have this set to a really high value so that they are immune to this mechanic.</p>
<p>Targetable
A true/false check for whether a player can target the monster with attacks and display its info
on the HUD.</p>
<p>Factions
The monster’s faction is set here, which is set up in a separate DBR. This determines what faction the
player gains/loses faction status with when killing the monster. It also determines what factions the
monster considers a foe, which can result in monster in-fighting.</p>
<p>Actor Variables
This section is mainly used to change the monster’s physical appearance, but the Description field is
used to assign a tag for the monster’s name.</p>
<p>Scripts
Under “Scripts”, you would assign Lua hooks for various trigger events. The most common one is onDie,
for when the monster is killed. This is often used to give out kill-credit tokens and open doors.</p>
<p>Character Bio
This is where the monsters BIO record is assigned, where its health, energy and other base attributes are
set.</p>
<p>BIO Record
The BIO Record controls the monster’s Physique (Strength), Cunning (Dexterity), Spirit
(Intelligence), Health (Life), Energy (Mana), Regeneration, Offensive Ability and Defensive
Ability. Each of these fields is an equation (example: (charLevel*5)+20) so that the monster’s
attributes scale with its level.</p>
<p>Natural Resistance
This sub-section is where you set the monster’s baseline resists to various damage types and
forms of crowd control.</p>
<p>Character Parameters
The only sub-section relevant here is the Character Speed, as the others are handled via the BIO Record.
Here you set the monster’s default speed modifiers (Run, Attack Speed, SpellCast Speed). The Run
Speed Jitter is used to apply additional variation (0-100) so that packs of the same monster will not all
run at the same speed and form more of a spread-out pack rather than a clump of enemies.</p>
<p>Reward
This section is used only to apply a money generator to the monster and the chance of dispensing it.
Additional loot rewards are set in the Initial Equipment section.</p>
<p>Initial Equipment
This section determines the equipment the monster is wearing and actively benefiting from. This means
that any bonuses the gear has will be applied to the monster. It also means that the equipment will drop
as part of the WYSIWYG Loot System.</p>
<p>The only exception to this is the Misc sub-section, where you can assign loot that is not equipped, but
can still drop from the monster when killed (example: components, Constitution Rations, rare crafting
materials, etc.). This can reference specific items or Loot Tables (Master Table or Dynamic Table, but not
Level Table)</p>
<p>Skill Tree
This is where all of the monster’s skills are assigned. The skill level can be a fixed value, or a formula that
allows the skill to scale with the monster’s level.</p>
<p>Skill Configuration
This section is where you control when and how often a monster uses its skills.</p>
<p> AttackSkill overrides the monster’s default auto-attacks with this skill. This is useful for
monsters that throw spell projectiles as their default attack.</p>
<p> buffSelfSkillName tells the monster to use this skill to buff itself, whether there are allies nearby
or not. The skill must have a cooldown set in the skill itself, or else the monster will spam it and
get stuck.
 buffOtherSkillName tells the monster to use this skill only to buff allies. It will not use this skill
unless allies are around to be buffed, even if it does not have the buff on itself. The cooldown
for this skill should be set on the skill itself, or else it may get spammed.
 nightBuffSkill is a toggled buff activated only during the night. Used to make monsters tougher
at night.
 healSkill tells the monster to use this skill to heal allies. It will not use it to heal itself.
 healSkillDelay tells the monster to wait this many seconds minimum between heals.
 berserkSkillName tells the monster to use this skill when it is low on health. Paired with
lowHealthTriggerLevel, which is a percent entered as 0-100.
 dyingSkillName tells the monster to cast this skill when it dies. Useful for creating damaging
fields or explosions on death.
 initialSkillName tells the monster to cast this skill when it spawns. This is used for monster
auras.
 specialAttack#SkillName controls specific skills, up to 5, based on the sub-parameters
 attackTimeout is how many seconds into combat the monster will wait before using this skill.
 attackDelay is how many seconds the monster will wait between uses of this skill
 attackChance is the chance that the monster will use the skill whenever the Delay runs out. If
this chance is not set to 100%, the monster may not use the skill and instead trigger another
Delay.
 attackRange is the range the player must be in for the monster to consider using the skill. The
options are Any, Short, Medium and Long. The values for these are set at the bottom. Usually,
Short is 0-4 for melee attacks, the others vary based on need.
 chainInitialSkill is used to tell the monster to use a specific sequence of skills. The initialSkill is
the triggering skill. The chainNextSkill is what skill it will use after the triggering skill is used. The
chainBehavior tells the monster what the target is for the NextSkill. The target is usually
CurrentEnemy.</p>
<p>Quest Marker
This is where you set what quests, if any, the monster is marked for on the map. You need to know the
quest File and the task ID. If the monster is relevant for more than one task in a quest, it needs multiple
entries.</p>
<p>The Marker Range determines how many meters away the player can be before the monster appears on
the map.</p>
<h2 id="monster-animations-appearance-and-sounds">Monster Animations, Appearance and Sounds</h2>
<p>These are references for advanced users who will be creating custom assets.</p>
<p>Animation
Monster animations are stored in a CharAnimationTable Record. This Record is assigned to the monster
under the Animation Set. This section has sub-fields where you can enter individual animations for the
monster, but generally you should use an Animation Set. If you have a monster with very limited
animations, such as a trap, then it makes sense to assign them directly to the monster.</p>
<p>Appearance
Monster appearance is dictated by several data fields in the Actor Variables section. Here you can set
the Base Mesh, Shader, and Texture Overrides (Base, Bump, Spec and Glow).</p>
<p>Sounds
Monster sounds are a located in the following sections:</p>
<p>Monster Parameters
Ambient, Alert, Rally, Rampage and Flee</p>
<p>Character Sounds
Attacks and Stunned</p>
<p>Animation Sounds
Critically Hit, Death, Vox, Body Fall and Special Animation References</p>
<p>Footsteps
Footsteps</p>
<h2 id="spawning-monsters">Spawning Monsters</h2>
<p>Generally when you place monsters in the world, you will want to do so via Proxies. Proxies can dispense
multiple enemies in an area, or even create an ambush.</p>
<p>Standard Proxy
A standard proxy dispenses monsters upon being loaded, based on its parameters.</p>
<p> Chance to Run: The Chance for this proxy to dispense upon load.
 Placement Extents: The area that this proxy will dispense monsters into, a radius around its
point of origin.
 Delayed Run: Used for Scripts and Devotion Shrines only.
 Faction Required: The Faction required for this Proxy to dispense.
 Faction Greater Than: True/false check for whether the player’s Faction status has to be greater
or less than the standing set.
 Faction Standing: The required Faction status.
 Difficulty At Least: The minimum difficulty this proxy dispenses on (Normal, Epic or Ultimate)
 Pool #: The Spawn Pool this Proxy dispenses, it can randomly choose between several Pools, if
more than one is assigned.
 Weight #: The relative weight of picking this Pool #.
 Time #: The time of day this Spawn Pool can dispense during (Always, Day or Night).</p>
<p>Ambush Proxy
An ambush proxy only dispenses when a player comes near its alert area. It has some additional
parameters that a standard proxy does not use.</p>
<p> Alert Area: The trigger area around the point of origin for this proxy that the player must enter
to trigger the spawn.
 Min/Max Spawn Time: The minimum/maximum time in seconds over which the proxy will
dispense monsters.
 Min/Max Delay Time: The minimum/maximum delay in seconds after triggering before the
proxy dispenses monsters.
 Min/Max Group Size: The minimum/maximum number of monsters the proxy will dispense at a
time.
 Spawn Threshold: The number of monsters that have to be remaining before more are
dispensed (if the total from the spawn pool was not already dispensed).</p>
<p>Spawn Pool
Spawn Pools are referenced by proxies to spawn a group of monsters. The distinction between the
Regular and Champion Pools is solely for controlling their spawn counts. You can spawn a Champion
monster from the Regular Pool. It makes no special distinction.</p>
<p> Spawn Min/Max: The number of monsters to spawn from the Regular Pool.
 Champion Min/Max: The number of monsters to spawn from the Champion Pool.
 Champion Chance: The chance of dispensing from the Champion Pool.
 Proxy Pool Equation: Record reference for modifying the spawn min/max values. The default
proxypoolequation_01.dbr is used for all Grim Dawn spawn pools.
 Ignore Game Balance: True/false check whether to use the difficulty modifiers that increase
spawn count. This is important for proxies that dispense a single entity, such as Aether Crystals,
as otherwise several crystals could spawn on top of each other.
 Name #: Record reference to a monster DBR.
 Weight #: The relative weight of dispensing this particular monster.
 Level Variance Equation #: Record reference to a level formula for the monster to spawn at. This
overrides the level formula set in the monster’s DBR.
 Limit #: the maximum number of this monster that can spawn from this pool.
 Min/Max Player Level #: The minimum/maximum player levels at which the monster will
appear. For example, heroes do not appear before level 8, so the min would be set to 8.
 Always Spawn #: True/false check for whether this monster always spawns with this pool.
Should always be coupled with a Limit as otherwise every monster that the pool dispenses will
be this monster.</p>
<h2 id="finishing-up_3">Finishing Up</h2>
<p>Compile your mod and you can place the monster in your level directly, or via a Proxy. You are all set!</p>
<h2 id="tutorial-06-creating-equipment">Tutorial 06: Creating Equipment</h2>
<p>Equipment is created and modified using Grim Dawn’s Database Record (DBR) Editor.</p>
<h2 id="item-record">Item Record</h2>
<p>The first step to creating an item is to create its Database Record (DBR). As items have varying gear slots,
the template for this record will vary, but the data fields are mostly the same regardless of item.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this tutorial, we will assume that you are not making new models, textures, bitmaps
and sound files for items but instead will be basing your equipment on existing assets.</p>
<p>Armor Config
In this section, you set the type of armor (Caster, Light or Heavy). This is mainly for display purposes as
the armor requirements and protection values are set independently of this.</p>
<p>Weapon Projectiles
This section is only available for ranged weapons. You can assign a custom projectile as well as a chance
for the weapon attacks to pierce through enemies.</p>
<p>Weapon Parameters
In this section, you can assign a custom weapon trail and attack effect.</p>
<p>Shield Config
This section is only available for shields.</p>
<p>Defensive Block Chance
The chance to block</p>
<p>Defensive Block
The damage blocked by the shield</p>
<p>Block Absorption
The % of damage that is absorbed by the shield, whereas the rest always goes through (the
same way Armor Absorption works). This is set to 100% for all shields in Grim Dawn.</p>
<p>Block Recovery Time
The minimum time in seconds between blocked attacks.</p>
<p>Item Parameters</p>
<p>Item Name Tag
A tag reference for the item’s name.</p>
<p>Item Quality Tag
A display-only tag reference that goes in front of the item name.</p>
<p>Item Style Tag
A display-only tag reference that goes in front of the item name.</p>
<p>Attribute Scale Percent
A % multiplier for all offensive damaging stats on the item, whether on the base item or on its
Affixes. Useful for rolling higher Affix bonuses on one type of item versus another (example:
melee weapons vs. ranged weapons) without the need to create additional copies of the same
Affixes.</p>
<p>Item Set Name
Record reference to a DBR that contains data for a Loot Set, what set bonuses it has and what
items are in the set. If an item is in a set, it must also reference the set here or else the set
bonuses will not appear in its tooltip.</p>
<p>Item Cost Name
Record reference to a DBR where various item values are calculated based on the item’s type.</p>
<p>Item Text
Additional text displayed underneath the item name, used for flavor text.</p>
<p>Item Classification
The Item’s quality (Common, Magic, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Quest). For display purposes only as
it does not affect the item’s inherent stats or drop rate.</p>
<p>Item Cost
This field is left blank if the Item Cost Name DBR is assigned as that overrides this. If you wish to
set a custom value for this item only, it is set here.</p>
<p>Item Level
The item’s level, which is important for loot tables.</p>
<p>Cannot Pick Up Multiple
A true/false check for whether the player can have multiples of this item in their inventory.
Mainly used for quest items.</p>
<p>Cannot Pick Up
A true/false check for whether the item can be picked up. For when you really hate people who
play your mod.</p>
<p>Soulbound
A true/false check for whether the item can be dropped, traded or placed in the Transfer Stash.</p>
<p>Untradeable
A true/false check for whether the item can be dropped or traded. Unlike Soulbound,
Untradeable items can still be placed in the Transfer Stash.</p>
<p>Item Requirements
The only field relevant here is the Level Requirement as the rest are controlled by the DBR assigned in
the Item Cost Name. If you wish to set a custom requirement for this item only, then you can do so here.</p>
<p>Quest Marker
This is where you set what quests, if any, the item is marked for on the map. You need to know the
quest File and the task ID. If the item is relevant for more than one task in a quest, it needs multiple
entries.</p>
<p>The Marker Range determines how many meters away the player can be before the item appears on the
map.</p>
<p>Racial Bonus
This section is used to give the item bonuses against specific game races. You can apply this bonus to
more than one race, but the value has to be the same for all of them. The default game races are as
follows:</p>
<p> Race001 = Undead
 Race002 = Beastkin
 Race003 = Aetherial
 Race004 = Chthonic
 Race005 = Aether Corruption
 Race006 = Bloodsworn
 Race007 = Eldritch
 Race008 = Insectoid
 Race009 = Human
 Race010 = Construct</p>
<p> Race011 = Riftspawn
 Race012 = Beast
 Race013 = Magical
 Race014 = Celestial
 Race015 = Arachnid</p>
<p>Skill Augment
This section is used to grant bonuses to Mastery skills and to bestow item skills.</p>
<p>Augment Skill Name #
This is a record reference to a mastery skill. If the skill is not in an existing player skill mastery, it
will show up as invalid in the item’s tooltip.</p>
<p>Augment Skill Level #
The skill rank bonus to the augmented skill.</p>
<p>Augment Mastery Name #
This is a record reference to a player mastery. It must reference the mastery’s Class Training
DBR.</p>
<p>Augment Mastery Level #
The skill rank bonus to all of the skills in the assigned mastery.</p>
<p>Augment All Level
The skill rank bonus to all of the player’s mastery skills.</p>
<p>Item Skill Name
If the item bestows a skill, the record is assigned her.</p>
<p>Item Skill Level Equation
The formula determining the rank of the assigned item skill. This should generally be a formula
for Affixes (example: itemLevel/4+1), but can be a fixed value for Unique items.</p>
<p>Item Skill Auto Controller
If the item is cast automatically rather than a granted skill the player can place on their quickbar,
the controller record is set here. The default item skill controllers are in
Records/Controllers/ItemSkills/.</p>
<p>Pet Bonus
This is a record reference to a pet bonus DBR. Pet bonus DBRs use a custom template but have the same
types of attributes as player items.</p>
<p>Offensive Parameters
This section is where all attributes that deal with damage are collected. Of particular importance is Item
Base Damage for Caster Weapons (you can set base magic damage here that is not affected by the
hardcoded stat variation, known as Jitter). The other important stat is the Offensive Physical sub-
section. If flat Physical Damage is set on Weapons or Shields, it will become that item’s base damage
value, which is not affected by Jitter.</p>
<p>For weapons, bonus flat Physical damage is set under the Offensive Bonus sub-section.</p>
<p>Retaliation Parameters
This section is where all attributes that deal with damage retaliation are collected.</p>
<p>Defensive Parameters
This section is where all attributes that deal with player defenses and damage reflection are collected.
Of particular importance is the Defensive Protection sub-section. If a flat Protection value is set on
Armor, it will become that item’s base armor value, which is not affected by Jitter.</p>
<p>For armor, bonus flat Protection is set under the Defensive Bonus Protection sub-section.</p>
<p>Character Parameters
This sub-section is where all player stats, regeneration, offensive/defensive ability, item requirement
reduction and speed bonuses are collected.</p>
<p>It is important to never set the characterRunSpeed/AttackSpeed/SpellCastSpeed values on items as
those values are actually decimals and used exclusively for adjusting base speed values on players and
monsters. Instead, use the Modifier fields.</p>
<p>Conversion Parameters
This section is where you set an item’s Damage Conversion bonuses. An item can only convert one
damage type to one other damage type. If the Conversion Out field is left blank, it will act as
Multiplicative Damage Reduction.</p>
<p>Skill Parameters
This section is where you can set Cooldown and Energy cost reduction as well as modify the speed of
ranged weapon attack projectiles.</p>
<h2 id="loot-chests">Loot Chests</h2>
<p>Loot Chests have two important parameters:</p>
<p>Loot Table
This is a record reference to a chest loot table. It is an array so you can override the loot table by
difficulty (1 = Normal, 2 = Elite, 3 = Ultimate).</p>
<p>Loot Classification
This classification determines which multipliers are used to determine the quality of its loot.</p>
<h2 id="item-loot-tables">Item Loot Tables</h2>
<p>Loot Tables are organized in a hierarchy. A loot table higher in the hierarchy should never be referenced
in a loot table beneath it.</p>
<p>Chest Loot Table</p>
<p>Chest Loot Tables are only referenced by chests. They can have Master Tables, Dynamic Tables of Items
assigned in their loot pool.</p>
<p>Number Spawn Min/Max Equation
The formula for number of items the chest will dispense. Typically this is a formula based on the
number of players</p>
<p>Loot # Chance
An array of weights for rolling this Loot Set. Each entry in the array is an item. If the chest can
dispense up to 2 items + 2 * the number of players, then the array should go up to at least 10.</p>
<p>Loot Name 1-6
The possible loot from this Loot Set.</p>
<p>Loot Weight 1-6
The relative weights of rolling loot within the Loot Set.</p>
<p>Master Table
Master tables combine Level tables and are the highest level of loot randomization in Grim Dawn that
can be assigned to monsters, quests and chest loot tables.</p>
<p>Level Table
Level tables control at what level a given Dynamic Table starts to be distributed. It has two arrays, one
for the levels and another for the Dynamic Tables. Each entry in the array corresponds to the same entry
in the other array.</p>
<p>Dynamic Table
Dynamic Tables are the lowest degree of loot randomization, but also the most important. This is where
individual items are randomized and assigned Affixes.</p>
<p>Config</p>
<p>The Config has several important parts:</p>
<p> Bell Slope: An array of multipliers for items based on their level. If an item’s level is equal to the
target level, then it uses the first multiplier, then the next closest item level uses the second
entry, etc.
 Min/Max Item Level Equation: The equations for the minimum and maximum item level that can
be generated from this loot table. If no items in the loot table fit within these parameters, the
loot table generates no loot.
 Target Level Equation: The equation for the target level the loot table is trying to generate. This
is coupled with the Bell Slope.
 Disable Level Limits: A true/false check for whether items generated from this loot table need to
fall within the parameters of the min/max item level equations and the minimum level enforced
by a Level Table. If set to True, items of any level can be generated by this loot table. This is
mainly important for potion tables and other tables that may have items of a level below that of
a Level Table that dispenses them.
 Affix Weights: These are relative weights of generating combinations of Affixes on the items
from this loot table. Broken items automatically disintegrate in Grim Dawn.</p>
<p>Loot</p>
<p>The Loot section is where individual items and their relative weights are set.</p>
<p>Randomizers</p>
<p>The Randomizers are where Affix tables are assigned. The Randomizers do not distinguish between
Prefixes and Suffixes so be sure to only assign tables with Prefixes to the Prefix Randomizers and Suffixes
to the Suffix Randomizers, otherwise your items could end up with two Prefixes or two Suffixes.</p>
<p>The Table Level Min/Max controls at what levels the given Affix table can be rolled. The Table Weight is
the relative weight of selecting a given Affix table over the others.</p>
<h2 id="finishing-up_4">Finishing Up</h2>
<p>Compile your mod and you can place the item in your level directly, or have it drop via monsters or loot
chests if assigned to their loot pool. You are all set!</p>
<h2 id="tutorial-07-lua-scripting-basics">Tutorial 07: Lua Scripting Basics</h2>
<p>This tutorial covers the basics of Lua scripting in Grim Dawn and is not intended as a proper tutorial for
Lua or programming. There are many great resources for learning to code/script that are available
online and we recommend checking them out before tackling Lua in Grim Dawn.</p>
<p>This tutorial outlines various C++ hooks created for Lua scripting in Grim Dawn.</p>
<h2 id="adding-new-scripts-for-mods">Adding New Scripts for Mods</h2>
<p>For tools purposes, it is important that your mod has its own version of main.lua in “source/Scripts/” as
an entry point. Typically, main.lua will load “scripts/libs/shared.lua” and “scripts/game/grimdawn.lua”,
but you can overwrite what grimdawn.lua loads within your mod.</p>
<h2 id="granting-multiplayer-quests">Granting Multiplayer Quests</h2>
<p>For NPC Conversations, only the talking player can accept quests or trigger scripted events. This is
important for quest decisions as multiple players speaking to the NPC at the same time could otherwise
trigger conflicting events (example: an NPC going hostile or remaining friendly). However, you may still
want to bestow quests and quest decisions in Multiplayer to the other players.</p>
<p>For this, you will need to set up scripts that bestow the quest after checking for the same conditions that
the speaking player had to go through within the dialogue. This is where knowing all of your quest and
task IDs is very important.</p>
<p>In this example, the player must have completed a prerequisite quest, but because the quest can be
completed retroactively, you also want to check for whether the second task was finished.</p>
<p>If your quest can be completed retroactively, you will also need to test for a new set of conditions and
bestow the Turn In step instead:</p>
<p>In this example, the player must have completed a prerequisite quest, is not already on the first task of
the quest (an unlikely scenario, but could happen in an odd combination of Multiplayer sessions) and
has a token confirming that they killed the boss before.</p>
<h2 id="questeventstring">QuestEvent(string)</h2>
<p>This function is used to execute a specific function from the Quest Event list that is then run by the Host.
This is important for executing a scripted event that affects the game world but may not necessarily
have been triggered by the Host player.</p>
<p>Example: a Client enters a trigger area that spawns an enemy based on the Host’s earlier quest choices.
As the world state is based on the Host, QuestEvent is run so that the spawn is executed by the Host
(which in turn spawns the monster for all players), rather than by the Client.</p>
<h2 id="questglobaleventstring">QuestGlobalEvent(string)</h2>
<p>This function is used to execute a specific function from the Quest Event list that is then run by all
players in a Multiplayer session. This is important for granting quests in Multiplayer or for bestowing
Tokens to all players based on one player’s actions.</p>
<h2 id="quest-event-list">Quest Event List</h2>
<p>Scripts intended to be run in Multiplayer, either by the host or by all players, are cataloged in
questevents.Lua.</p>
<p>Example: repairWightmireBridgeToken = gd.quests.burrwitchBridges.wightmireBridgeRepairGlobalMP,</p>
<p>If QuestGlobalEvent(“repairWightmireBridgeToken”) is then run, all players in the Multiplayer session
will run the function, which bestows a Token for that tracks whether the bridge was restored by the
player.</p>
<h2 id="grim-dawn-script-reference">Grim Dawn Script Reference</h2>
<p>Static methods can be called directly on the class (example: Game.GetLocalPlayer()). Instance methods
require an instance of the class to operate on. To get an instance, often, Class.Get(id) is used (example:
Game.GetLocalPlayer():GetPlayerName() returns the name of the local player). Constructors can be used
to create a new instance of a class.</p>
<p>The format for static methods:</p>
<p>ReturnType Class.MethodName(ArgType1 argName1, ArgType2 argName2, ...)</p>
<p>The format for instance methods:</p>
<p>ReturnType instance:MethodName(ArgType1 argName1, ArgType2 argName2, ...)</p>
<p>Methods with no return type do not include one.</p>
<p>The format for instance variables:</p>
<p>VariableType instance:VariableName</p>
<p>Comments and Operators</p>
<p>-- Single-line comment</p>
<p>/* Multi-line</p>
<p>comments
*/</p>
<p>!= Not-Equal operator, rather than Lua’s standard ~=</p>
<p>&amp;&amp; AND operator, rather than Lua’s standard “and”</p>
<p>|| OR operator, rather than Lua’s standard “or”</p>
<p>‘If Server then’ this check is performed at the beginning of functions that impact the world
state as a precautionary measure so that only the Host is executing them.</p>
<p>Token Checks</p>
<p>GiveTokenIfPlayer(id, token)</p>
<p>GiveTokenToLocalPlayer(token)</p>
<p>RemoveTokenFromLocalPlayer(token)</p>
<p>State Based Object Swap
This series of functions has been written to handle the swapping of objects and entities in the world
based on the Host player’s Tokens. Script Entities run these functions upon loading and unloading. The
Update function is called independently to update the state of a Script Entity that is already loaded
(example: an NPC the player is talking to switches to a hostile state).</p>
<p>TokenStateBasedObjectSwap(objectid, userdata, states, cls, argsfn, MPOverrideState,
MPOverrideDbr)</p>
<p>UpdateObjectSwap(objectid, states, cls, argsfn, MPOverrideState, MPOverrideDbr)</p>
<p>ClearObjectUserdata(objectid)</p>
<p> 'id' is the id of the script entity
 'userdata' is a table containing the current state and object
 'states' is an ordered table containing a mapping of tokens (in order of precedence) to state/dbr
pairs
 'class' is the class used to create the entity
 'argsfn' is a function used to pass extra arguments to the class create method
 'MPOverrideState' boolean determining whether the MPOVerrideDbr should be used. If true,
the override is used instead of the host's current token state.
 'MPOverrideDbr' is a Dbr override used in the case that a client is on a quest the host is not that
requires an entity state change (such as an NPC going hostile)
 Returns 2 values:
'didWork' (boolean) - True if a swap occurred based on changes in tokens or MPOverrideState.
'newState' - The new state of the object is a swap occurred, or the current state if one didn't.</p>
