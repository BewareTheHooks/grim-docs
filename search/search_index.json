Because these are the same tools we used to create the game itself, they offer an exceptional degree of freedom for you to edit and create your very own content.</p> <p>Modding can be a challenging, but rewarding endeavor. The freedom provided by our tools does mean that there is a steeper learning curve if you wish to tackle some of its more powerful functions. Not all tasks are created equal. For example, editing an item\u2019s stats is considerably easier than scripting an event where monsters attack a village.</p> <p>To aid you in the creation of your first mod, we have created these tutorials, which go over the basics of using Grim Dawn\u2019s modding tools and get you started on your way to creating your own content!</p> <p>Note that these tutorials are not fully comprehensive.

A proxy is grouped this way, then Linked to a group of Patrol Points. \uf0b7 Unique Entities, used to randomly create only one entity out of a group. This is useful for randomizing where a Proxy or SetPiece Spawns \uf0b7 Inverse Unique Entities, used to randomly create all but one of the entities in a group. This is useful for randomizing barriers such that only one way through is open. \uf0b7 Any Entity, used to group together randomized Rifts. Only one will appear in the world. \uf0b7 Decorations, used to group Decorations together. This is seldom used with the SetPiece system, which uses Unique Entities. \uf0b7 Patrol Points, used to group Patrol Points for a Proxy to follow. \uf0b7 Monsters and Weapons, this is an old setting and is no longer used with Proxies and SetPieces. \uf0b7 Patrollers, used similarly to Proxy Patrollers but for individual entities such as guards. \uf0b7 Wander Points, used to group Wander Points for NPCs to follow. As we keep NPCs static, this is unused. \uf0b7 NPC wanderers, used similarly to Proxy Patrollers but for individual NPCs. \uf0b7 Riftgates, used to link all of the Riftgates in the world so they become a network for fast travel. If a riftgate is not in this group, it will not be remembered by the player\u2019s character. \uf0b7 Dungeon Entrances, used to link transition doors together. This is important for Dungeon Entrances and transitions between dungeon floors. \uf0b7 Devotion Shrines, used to link all Devotion Shrines in the world so they become a network. If a shrine is not in this group, it will not be properly stored by the player\u2019s character.</p> <p>Link Mode is used to connect dungeon entrances when one or both sides are randomized (ex. Randomized Rift entrance). It is important that the link is made in both directions or the entrance will not work.

Generally, holding Shift will alternate its functionality whereas Alt will prevent the terrain tool from displacing already placed assets.</p> <p>Raise/Lower Tool Use this tool to raise or lower the terrain.</p> <p>Noise Tool Use this tool to create randomized bumps in the terrain.</p> <p>Smooth Tool Use this tool to even out the variation between terrain of differing heights.</p> <p>Plateau Tool Use this tool to set a section of terrain to a fixed height.</p> <p>Raise Plateau Tool Use this tool to raise the terrain by a fixed amount. The relative difference between terrain remains the same.</p> <p>Copy Terrain Tool This tool functions similarly to copying and pasting in a text document. CTRL+C copies an area, CTRL+V pastes it. Left-clicking also pastes your last selection.</p> <p>Ramp Tool Use this tool to create ramps from the starting point to the end point you click and hold to.</p> <p>Brush Tool Use this tool to apply terrain textures. You can also set it to apply onto paintable decorations, such as slabs of stone or bridges.</p> <p>No Pathing Tool Use this tool to paint over areas you do not want players or monsters to go. Areas painted this way will be omitted when you generate pathing for your level. This only functions on terrain. Objects that generate a path mesh will override this if they are over the painted area.</p> <p>Sector Paint Tool Use this tool to apply various environmental settings, such as Lighting and Level Limits.</p> <p>Fog/Lighting Layer The Fog/Lighting Layer is used to control the ambience of the region. For Fog, you can set the visible distance, density, height and color. For Lighting, you can set the Light Color, the Ambient color for the sky and the Ambient color for the ground. Example, the atmosphere turns to an Aether green when entering Aetherfire. That visual is set in this layer.</p> <p>Name Layer The Name Layer determines what name appears whenever the player enters the area (ex. Devil\u2019s Crossing appears on screen when enering Devil\u2019s Crossing).</p> <p>\uf0b7 Localization Tag \u2013 the tag reference to what players see. \uf0b7 Cinematic Display \u2013 checked so the name appears in the center of the screen when first entering the area. \uf0b7 Display Once \u2013 unchecked, otherwise the name only appears the first time.</p> <p>Sound Layer The Sound Layer is used to set the music and ambient sounds for an area. The sound layer references DBRs.</p> <p>\uf0b7 Ambient Music \u2013 what music is played in this area. \uf0b7 Ambient Sound \u2013 what ambient sounds randomly play in this area. \uf0b7 Event Music \u2013 music triggered by a special event.</p> <p>Boss Layer The Boss Layer is used to control where special Boss Music plays. It has no settings of its own and must be associated with a Boss Monster that has custom Music assigned to it.</p> <p>Day/Night Cycle Layer The Day/Night Cycle Layer controls the atmospheric effects simulating sunrise/sundown.</p> <p>Bloom Layer The Bloom Layer is an atmospherics layer used to adjust the Brightness, Contrast and Saturation for the bright areas in a scene. It works similarly to HDR.</p> <p>Climate Layer The Climate Layer is used to control weather effects such as dense fog, rain, wind, etc. The Climate layer references a Climate DBR, which is where all of the settings are stored.</p> <p>Damage Layer The Damage Layer is used to deal damage to the player when they enter an environmental hazard. You set the type of damage, the visual effect (generally should be the one associated with the damage type) and the % health that is lost per second of standing within the hazard.</p> <p>Adjustment Layer The Adjustment Layer is another atmospheric layer which controls the Brightness, Contrast, Saturation and Hue of the entire scene. Unlike the Bloom Layer, it also impacts dark areas.</p> <p>Level Limit Layer The Level Limit Layer controls what level monsters can spawn in the area. The Minimum level and Maximum level are used whenever the player\u2019s level falls outside of that range, otherwise the player\u2019s level is used. The Offset is added to the player\u2019s level so that monsters always end up a few levels above the player (unless the player\u2019s level is above Maximum level). The Offset is only used in challenge areas.</p> <p>Riftgate Disable Layer The Riftgate Disable Layer is used to prevent players from being able to open a Personal Riftgate while within the area. It is used exclusive for very challenging areas or for Faction-Only hideouts.</p> <p>View Distance Layer This layer is used to control how far away objects are loaded, to improve performance in areas where you do not necessarily see more than a few dozen meters out. A really flat area could be set to 80m, while a really tall mountain may need 300.</p> <p>PVP Layer: The area painted over with this layer disables Player versus Player hostility.

Using these you can create an intricate dialogue web with many resolutions and bits of information.

The Monster Record references other records and assets, such as sounds and animations. Generally it is better to take an existing DBR and modify it as there are many data fields that must be entered which will not be covered in this guide.</p> <p>For the purpose of this tutorial, we will assume that you are not making new models, animations or sound files but instead will be basing your monster on an existing archetype.</p> <p>Monster Parameters</p> <p>Monster Controller The Monster Controller is a separate DBR that sets various parameters for the monster such as when to flee, when to assist, vision range, hate generation (threat), and more. For the most part, you will be using existing Controllers.</p> <p>Monster Classification The monster classification determines the color of the monster\u2019s name in the Target Info section of the HUD as well as the multipliers the monster uses to determine the quality of its loot.</p> <p>\uf0b7 Common: used for fodder monsters that pose minimal challenge individually \uf0b7 Champion: used for mid-tier monsters that pose some challenge individually but throw in additional mechanics in a group fight and should be prioritized. \uf0b7 Hero: used for hero monsters with custom skill sets. They are marked by a hero star above their head. \uf0b7 Quest: used for boss and mini-boss monsters with custom skill sets. \uf0b7 Boss: used for Nemesis bosses.</p> <p>Per Party Member Drop Item Name/Chance This parameter is used to set what item this monster drops per player in a multiplayer session. You can also set a chance if you do not wish for it to drop 100% of the time. Useful for quest drops and lore notes.</p> <p>Drop Items A true/false check for whether the monster can drop what it has equipped. Generally set to False for summons and true for everything else.</p> <p>Give XP A true/false check for whether the monster grants XP when killed. Generally set to False for summons and true for everything else.</p> <p>Health Gain on Kill Percent/Difficulty The % Health the monster regains if it kills a player. The Difficulty determines at what difficulty this health regains activates (0 = Normal, 1 = Veteran, 2 = Elite, 3 = Ultimate). For all bosses, the health regain starts on Veteran. Nemesis bosses regain health regardless of difficulty.</p> <p>Character</p> <p>Char Level The Char Level is an equation for the monster\u2019s level relative to the player\u2019s. This is only used if the monster is placed directly into the world and not spawned via Proxy. The Min/Max Level parameters are caps on the formula. (example formula: charLevel*1+3)</p> <p>Experience Points Bonus experience for killing this monster, generally only set for heroes and above.</p> <p>Character Gender Profile The Gender Profile is used only for Human-based monsters as it determines the equipment gender overrides (if set incorrectly you could end up with A female character using a male torso).</p> <p>Character Racial Profile The Racial Profile is used to tag the monster with various Cairn races for the purposes of Bonus Damage. A monster may have more than one profile at a time (Example: Human Cultists are both Human and Bloodsworn). The default game races are as follows:</p> <p>\uf0b7 Race001 = Undead \uf0b7 Race002 = Beastkin \uf0b7 Race003 = Aetherial \uf0b7 Race004 = Chthonic \uf0b7 Race005 = Aether Corruption \uf0b7 Race006 = Bloodsworn \uf0b7 Race007 = Eldritch \uf0b7 Race008 = Insectoid \uf0b7 Race009 = Human \uf0b7 Race010 = Construct \uf0b7 Race011 = Riftspawn \uf0b7 Race012 = Beast \uf0b7 Race013 = Magical \uf0b7 Race014 = Celestial \uf0b7 Race015 = Arachnid</p> <p>Default Equipment The default equipment is used to give the monster items to visually change its appearance without that equipment having a chance to drop. This is mostly relevant for Human-based monsters that wear player equipment visually, but is also relevant for tribal monsters where the champions might wear armor (that the player cannot wear) while the fodder monsters do not.</p> <p>Weapon Scale Weapon Scale is used to scale up the model size of any weapons the monster uses, useful for large monsters that use player gear. When the weapons drop, they are reduced back down to the original scale.</p> <p>Number Attack/Defense Slots Attack Slots are important for very large monsters so that pets and other entities can attack them at the same time. The Default of 4 is sufficient in most cases, but a particularly large</p> <p>monster may need more if it is difficult for entities to reach it from multiple sides (example: the Loghorrean uses 26).</p> <p>Start Visible A true/false check whether the monster initially spawns visible. This is important for monsters that are ambushing from above. These monsters must be set to appear visible in the spawn animation or else they will be permanently invisible.</p> <p>Distress Call A true/false check on whether the monster calls for help. If set to true, the range determines how far the distress call reaches, the group determines the group of monsters that is called (all monsters with the same group set here and in the controller will respond), the call time is the delay between additional distress calls and the max calls is the maximum number of times the monster will call for help.</p> <p>Invincible If set to true, this monster cannot be killed. This is useful for environment traps.</p> <p>Hidden From Combat If set to true, the monster will not cause other non-player entities to attack it.</p> <p>Causes Anger / Anger Multiplier A true/false check on whether the monster generates threat with other non-player entities. The multiplier can be used to reduce its threat generated without completely disabling it.</p> <p>Upper/Lower Health Display Percentage Used for bosses with multiple phases. This way you can keep one continuous health progress bar across all phases. The Upper is the starting % of health and Lower is the ending % of Health when the next phase would begin. (Example: Phase 1 would be 100 for Upper and 50 for Lower and Phase 2 would be 50 for Upper and 0 for Lower in a two phase encounter).</p> <p>Hit Threshold The % of health the monster must lose in one hit before it is staggered by the blow. Bosses generally have this set to a really high value so that they are immune to this mechanic.</p> <p>Targetable A true/false check for whether a player can target the monster with attacks and display its info on the HUD.</p> <p>Factions The monster\u2019s faction is set here, which is set up in a separate DBR. This determines what faction the player gains/loses faction status with when killing the monster. It also determines what factions the monster considers a foe, which can result in monster in-fighting.</p> <p>Actor Variables This section is mainly used to change the monster\u2019s physical appearance, but the Description field is used to assign a tag for the monster\u2019s name.</p> <p>Scripts Under \u201cScripts\u201d, you would assign Lua hooks for various trigger events. The most common one is onDie, for when the monster is killed. This is often used to give out kill-credit tokens and open doors.</p> <p>Character Bio This is where the monsters BIO record is assigned, where its health, energy and other base attributes are set.</p> <p>BIO Record The BIO Record controls the monster\u2019s Physique (Strength), Cunning (Dexterity), Spirit (Intelligence), Health (Life), Energy (Mana), Regeneration, Offensive Ability and Defensive Ability. Each of these fields is an equation (example: (charLevel*5)+20) so that the monster\u2019s attributes scale with its level.</p> <p>Natural Resistance This sub-section is where you set the monster\u2019s baseline resists to various damage types and forms of crowd control.</p> <p>Character Parameters The only sub-section relevant here is the Character Speed, as the others are handled via the BIO Record. Here you set the monster\u2019s default speed modifiers (Run, Attack Speed, SpellCast Speed). The Run Speed Jitter is used to apply additional variation (0-100) so that packs of the same monster will not all run at the same speed and form more of a spread-out pack rather than a clump of enemies.</p> <p>Reward This section is used only to apply a money generator to the monster and the chance of dispensing it. Additional loot rewards are set in the Initial Equipment section.</p> <p>Initial Equipment This section determines the equipment the monster is wearing and actively benefiting from. This means that any bonuses the gear has will be applied to the monster. It also means that the equipment will drop as part of the WYSIWYG Loot System.</p> <p>The only exception to this is the Misc sub-section, where you can assign loot that is not equipped, but can still drop from the monster when killed (example: components, Constitution Rations, rare crafting materials, etc.). This can reference specific items or Loot Tables (Master Table or Dynamic Table, but not Level Table)</p> <p>Skill Tree This is where all of the monster\u2019s skills are assigned. The skill level can be a fixed value, or a formula that allows the skill to scale with the monster\u2019s level.</p> <p>Skill Configuration This section is where you control when and how often a monster uses its skills.</p> <p>\uf0b7 AttackSkill overrides the monster\u2019s default auto-attacks with this skill. This is useful for monsters that throw spell projectiles as their default attack.</p> <p>\uf0b7 buffSelfSkillName tells the monster to use this skill to buff itself, whether there are allies nearby or not. The skill must have a cooldown set in the skill itself, or else the monster will spam it and get stuck. \uf0b7 buffOtherSkillName tells the monster to use this skill only to buff allies. It will not use this skill unless allies are around to be buffed, even if it does not have the buff on itself. The cooldown for this skill should be set on the skill itself, or else it may get spammed. \uf0b7 nightBuffSkill is a toggled buff activated only during the night. Used to make monsters tougher at night. \uf0b7 healSkill tells the monster to use this skill to heal allies. It will not use it to heal itself. \uf0b7 healSkillDelay tells the monster to wait this many seconds minimum between heals. \uf0b7 berserkSkillName tells the monster to use this skill when it is low on health. Paired with lowHealthTriggerLevel, which is a percent entered as 0-100. \uf0b7 dyingSkillName tells the monster to cast this skill when it dies. Useful for creating damaging fields or explosions on death. \uf0b7 initialSkillName tells the monster to cast this skill when it spawns. This is used for monster auras. \uf0b7 specialAttack#SkillName controls specific skills, up to 5, based on the sub-parameters \uf0b7 attackTimeout is how many seconds into combat the monster will wait before using this skill. \uf0b7 attackDelay is how many seconds the monster will wait between uses of this skill \uf0b7 attackChance is the chance that the monster will use the skill whenever the Delay runs out. If this chance is not set to 100%, the monster may not use the skill and instead trigger another Delay. \uf0b7 attackRange is the range the player must be in for the monster to consider using the skill. The options are Any, Short, Medium and Long. The values for these are set at the bottom. Usually, Short is 0-4 for melee attacks, the others vary based on need. \uf0b7 chainInitialSkill is used to tell the monster to use a specific sequence of skills. The initialSkill is the triggering skill. The chainNextSkill is what skill it will use after the triggering skill is used. The chainBehavior tells the monster what the target is for the NextSkill. The target is usually CurrentEnemy.</p> <p>Quest Marker This is where you set what quests, if any, the monster is marked for on the map. You need to know the quest File and the task ID. If the monster is relevant for more than one task in a quest, it needs multiple entries.</p> <p>The Marker Range determines how many meters away the player can be before the monster appears on the map.</p>"},{"location":"crate-pdf-guide/#monster-animations-appearance-and-sounds","title":"Monster Animations, Appearance and Sounds","text":"<p>These are references for advanced users who will be creating custom assets.</p> <p>Animation Monster animations are stored in a CharAnimationTable Record.

If you have a monster with very limited animations, such as a trap, then it makes sense to assign them directly to the monster.</p> <p>Appearance Monster appearance is dictated by several data fields in the Actor Variables section. Here you can set the Base Mesh, Shader, and Texture Overrides (Base, Bump, Spec and Glow).</p> <p>Sounds Monster sounds are a located in the following sections:</p> <p>Monster Parameters Ambient, Alert, Rally, Rampage and Flee</p> <p>Character Sounds Attacks and Stunned</p> <p>Animation Sounds Critically Hit, Death, Vox, Body Fall and Special Animation References</p> <p>Footsteps Footsteps</p>"},{"location":"crate-pdf-guide/#spawning-monsters","title":"Spawning Monsters","text":"<p>Generally when you place monsters in the world, you will want to do so via Proxies.

It has two arrays, one for the levels and another for the Dynamic Tables. Each entry in the array corresponds to the same entry in the other array.</p> <p>Dynamic Table Dynamic Tables are the lowest degree of loot randomization, but also the most important. This is where individual items are randomized and assigned Affixes.</p> <p>Config</p> <p>The Config has several important parts:</p> <p>\uf0b7 Bell Slope: An array of multipliers for items based on their level. If an item\u2019s level is equal to the target level, then it uses the first multiplier, then the next closest item level uses the second entry, etc. \uf0b7 Min/Max Item Level Equation: The equations for the minimum and maximum item level that can be generated from this loot table. If no items in the loot table fit within these parameters, the loot table generates no loot. \uf0b7 Target Level Equation: The equation for the target level the loot table is trying to generate. This is coupled with the Bell Slope. \uf0b7 Disable Level Limits: A true/false check for whether items generated from this loot table need to fall within the parameters of the min/max item level equations and the minimum level enforced by a Level Table. If set to True, items of any level can be generated by this loot table. This is mainly important for potion tables and other tables that may have items of a level below that of a Level Table that dispenses them. \uf0b7 Affix Weights: These are relative weights of generating combinations of Affixes on the items from this loot table. Broken items automatically disintegrate in Grim Dawn.</p> <p>Loot</p> <p>The Loot section is where individual items and their relative weights are set.</p> <p>Randomizers</p> <p>The Randomizers are where Affix tables are assigned. The Randomizers do not distinguish between Prefixes and Suffixes so be sure to only assign tables with Prefixes to the Prefix Randomizers and Suffixes to the Suffix Randomizers, otherwise your items could end up with two Prefixes or two Suffixes.</p> <p>The Table Level Min/Max controls at what levels the given Affix table can be rolled. The Table Weight is the relative weight of selecting a given Affix table over the others.</p>"},{"location":"crate-pdf-guide/#finishing-up_4","title":"Finishing Up","text":"<p>Compile your mod and you can place the item in your level directly, or have it drop via monsters or loot chests if assigned to their loot pool.
